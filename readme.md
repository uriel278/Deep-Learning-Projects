<h3>Neural Network from Scratch</h3>
This is the first of the projects of my journey through learning DL and neural nets.
This is a toy project for a feedforward neural net with a vectorized implementation
of the backpropagation algorithm. This includes a Jupyter notebook with some architetures
implementations such as Feedforward nets and Autoencoders.

You are free to download and play with the code (and maybe improve it).
